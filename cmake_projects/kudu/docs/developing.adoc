= Developing Applications With Kudu

Kudu provides C++ and Java client APIs, as well as reference examples to illustrate
their use. A Python API is included, but it is currently considered experimental,
unstable, and subject to change at any time.

WARNING: Use of server-side or private interfaces is not supported, and interfaces
which are not part of public APIs have no stability guarantees.

== Viewing the API Documentation
include::installation.adoc[tags=view_api]

== Working Examples

Several example applications are provided in the
link:https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples[kudu-examples] Github
repository. Each example includes a `README` that shows how to compile and run
it. These examples illustrate correct usage of the Kudu APIs, as well as how to
set up a virtual machine to run Kudu. The following list includes some of the
examples that are available today. Check the repository itself in case this list goes
out of date.

`java-example`::
  A simple Java application which connects to a Kudu instance, creates a table, writes data to it, then drops the table.
`collectl`::
  A small Java application which listens on a TCP socket for time series data corresponding to the Collectl wire protocol.
  The commonly-available collectl tool can be used to send example data to the server.
`clients/python`::
  An experimental Python client for Kudu.
`demo-vm-setup`::
  Scripts to download and run a VirtualBox virtual machine with Kudu already installed.
  See link:quickstart.html[Quickstart] for more information.

These examples should serve as helpful starting points for your own Kudu applications and integrations.

== Example Impala Commands With Kudu

See link:kudu_impala_integration.html[Using Impala With Kudu] for guidance on installing
and using Impala with Kudu, including several `impala-shell` examples.

== Integration with MapReduce, YARN, and Other Frameworks

Kudu was designed to integrate with MapReduce, YARN, Spark, and other frameworks in
the Hadoop ecosystem. See link:https://github.com/cloudera/kudu/blob/master/java/kudu-client-tools/src/main/java/org/kududb/mapreduce/tools/RowCounter.java[RowCounter.java]
and
link:https://github.com/cloudera/kudu/blob/master/java/kudu-client-tools/src/main/java/org/kududb/mapreduce/tools/ImportCsv.java[ImportCsv.java]
for examples which you can model your own integrations on. Stay tuned for more examples
using YARN and Spark in the future.

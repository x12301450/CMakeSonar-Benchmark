You can deploy Kudu on a cluster using packages or you can build Kudu
from source. To run Kudu without installing anything, use the link:quickstart.html#quickstart_vm[Kudu Quickstart VM].

NOTE: Kudu is currently easier to install and manage with link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cloudera-enterprise/cloudera-manager.html[Cloudera Manager],
version 5.4.7 or newer. If you use Cloudera Manager, see also Cloudera's
link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/betas/kudu/0-5-0.html[Kudu documentation].

== Prerequisites and Requirements
.Hardware
- A host to run the Kudu master.
- One or more hosts to run Kudu tablet servers. When using replication, a minimum of
three tablet servers is necessary.

.Operating System
- RHEL 6 or Ubuntu Trusty
- A kernel version and filesystem that support _hole punching_. On Linux, hole punching
is the use of the `fallocate()` system call with the `FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE` option
set. See link:troubleshooting.html#req_hole_punching[troubleshooting hole punching] for more
information.
- OSX and Windows are not supported, even for building from source.

.Storage
- If solid state storage is available, storing Kudu WALs on such high-performance
media may significantly improve latency when Kudu is configured for its highest
durability levels.

[[install_packages]]
== Install Using Packages
You can install Kudu using packages managed by the operating system.

[[kudu_package_locations]]
.Kudu Package Locations
[cols=">s,<,<",options="header"]
|===
| OS  | Repository  | Individual Packages
| RHEL | link:http://archive.cloudera.com/beta/kudu/redhat/6/x86_64/kudu/cloudera-kudu.repo[RHEL 6] |  link:http://archive.cloudera.com/beta/kudu/redhat/6/x86_64/kudu/0.5.0/RPMS/x86_64/[RHEL 6]
| Ubuntu | link:http://archive.cloudera.com/beta/kudu/ubuntu/trusty/amd64/kudu/cloudera.list[Trusty] |  http://archive.cloudera.com/beta/kudu/ubuntu/trusty/amd64/kudu/pool/contrib/k/kudu/[Trusty]
|===

NOTE: For later versions of Ubuntu, the Ubuntu Trusty packages are reported to install, though they have not been extensively tested.

=== Install On RHEL Hosts

. Download and configure the Kudu repositories for your operating system, or manually
download individual RPMs, the appropriate link from <<kudu_package_locations>>.

. If using a Yum repository, use the following commands to install Kudu packages on
each host.
+
----
sudo yum install kudu                         # Base Kudu files
sudo yum install kudu-master                  # Kudu master init.d service script and default configuration
sudo yum install kudu-tserver                 # Kudu tablet server init.d service script and default configuration
sudo yum install kudu-client                  # Kudu C++ client shared library
sudo yum install kudu-client-devel            # Kudu C++ client SDK
----

. To manually install the Kudu RPMs, first download them, then use the command
`sudo rpm -ivh <RPM to install>` and install the
`kudu-master` and `kudu-tserver` packages on the appropriate hosts. These packages
provide the operating system commands to start and stop Kudu.

=== Install On Ubuntu or Debian Hosts

. If using an Ubuntu or Debian repository, use the following commands to install Kudu
packages on each host.
+
----
sudo apt-get install kudu                     # Base Kudu files
sudo apt-get install kudu-master              # Service scripts for managing kudu-master
sudo apt-get install kudu-tserver             # Service scripts for managing kudu-tserver
sudo apt-get install libkuduclient0           # Kudu C++ client shared library
sudo apt-get install libkuduclient-dev       # Kudu C++ client SDK
----

. To manually install individual DEBs, first download them, then use the command
`sudo dpkg -i <DEB to install>` to install them.

+
// tag::verify_install[]
. Verify that services are running using one of the following methods:
  - Examine the output of the `ps` command on servers to verify one or both of `kudu-master`
  or `kudu-tserver` processes is running.
  - Access the Master or Tablet Server web UI by opening `\http://<_host_name_>:8051/`
  for masters
  or `\http://<_host_name_>:8050/` for tablet servers.
+
// end::verify_install[]

[[required_config_without_cm]]
=== Required Configuration

Additional configuration steps are required on each host before you can start Kudu services.

. The packages create a `kudu-conf` entry in the operating system's alternatives database,
and they ship the built-in `conf.dist` alternative. To adjust your configuration,
you can either edit the files in `/etc/kudu/conf/` directly, or create a new alternative
using the operating system utilities, make sure it is the link pointed to by `/etc/kudu/conf/`,
and create custom configuration files there. Some parts of the configuration are configured
in `/etc/default/kudu-master` and `/etc/default/kudu-tserver` files as well. You
should include or duplicate these configuration options if you create custom configuration files.
+
Review the configuration, including the default WAL and data directory locations,
and adjust them according to your requirements.

// tag::start_stop[]
. Start Kudu services using the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo service kudu-master start
$ sudo service kudu-tserver start
----

. To stop Kudu services, use the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo service kudu-master stop
$ sudo service kudu-tserver stop
----
// end::start_stop[]

. Configure the Kudu services to start automatically when the server starts, by adding
them to the default runlevel.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo chkconfig kudu-master on                # RHEL / CentOS
$ sudo chkconfig kudu-tserver on               # RHEL / CentOS

$ sudo update-rc.d kudu-master defaults        # Debian / Ubuntu
$ sudo update-rc.d kudu-tserver defaults       # Debian / Ubuntu
----

. For additional configuration of Kudu services, see link:configuration.html[Configuring
Kudu].

== Build From Source
If installing Kudu using parcels or packages does not provide the flexibility you
need, you can build Kudu from source. You can build from source on any supported operating system.

[WARNING]
.Known Build Issues
====
* It is not possible to build Kudu on OSX or Microsoft Windows.
* Do not build Kudu using `gcc` 4.6. It is known to cause runtime and test failures.
====

=== RHEL or CentOS
. Install the prerequisite libraries, if they are not installed:
+
----

[[build_cpp_client]]
== Installing the C++ Client Libraries

If you need access to the Kudu client libraries for development,
install the `kudu-client` and `kudu-client-devel` package for your platform.
See <<install_packages>>.

WARNING: Only build against the client libraries and headers (`kudu_client.so` and `client.h`).
Other libraries and headers are internal to Kudu and have no stability guarantees.

[[build_java_client]]
== Build the Java Client

.Requirements
- JDK 7
- Apache Maven 3.x
- `protoc` 2.6 or newer installed in your path, or built from the `thirdparty/` directory.
You can run the following commands to build `protoc` from the third-party dependencies:
[source,bash]
----
$ thirdparty/download-thirdparty.sh
$ thirdparty/build-thirdparty.sh protobuf
----

To build the Java client, clone the Kudu Git
repository, change to the `java` directory, and issue the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn install -DskipTests
----

For more information about building the Java API, as well as Eclipse integration,
see `java/README.md`.

[[view_api]]
== View API Documentation

// tag::view_api[]
.C++ API Documentation
The documentation for the C++ client APIs is included in the header files in
`/usr/include/kudu/` if you installed Kudu using packages or subdirectories
of `src/kudu/client/` if you built Kudu from source. If you installed Kudu using parcels,
no headers are included in your installation. and you will need to <<build_kudu,build
Kudu from source>> in order to have access to the headers and shared libraries.

The following command is a naive approach to finding relevant header files. Use
of any APIs other than the client APIs is unsupported.

[source,bash]
----
$ find /usr/include/kudu -type f -name *.h
----

.Java API Documentation
You can view the link:../apidocs/index.html[Java API documentation] online. Alternatively,
after <<build_java_client,building the Java client>>, Java API documentation is available
in `java/kudu-client/target/apidocs/index.html`.

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Kudu VM, and start with Kudu, Kudu_Impala,
and CDH in minutes.


[[quickstart_vm]]
== Get The Kudu Quickstart VM

=== Prerequisites

1. Install https://www.virtualbox.org/[Oracle Virtualbox]. The VM has been tested to work
with VirtualBox version 4.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 and VirtualBox version 5 on OSX
10.9. VirtualBox is also included in most package managers: apt-get, brew, etc.

2. After the installation, make sure that `VBoxManage` is in your `PATH` by using the
`which VBoxManage` command.

=== Installation

To download and start the VM, execute the following command in a terminal window.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudera/kudu-examples/master/demo-vm-setup/bootstrap.sh | bash
----

This command downloads a shell script which clones the `kudu-examples` Git repository and
then downloads a VM image of about 1.2GB size into the current working
directory.footnote:[In addition, the script will create a host-only network between host
and guest and setup an enty in the `/etc/hosts` file with the name `quickstart.cloudera`
and the guest's IP address.] You can examine the script after downloading it by removing
the `| bash` component of the command above. Once the setup is complete, you can verify
that everything works by connecting to the guest via SSH:

[source,bash]
----
$ ssh demo@quickstart.cloudera
----

The username and password for the demo account are both `demo`. In addition, the `demo`
user has password-less `sudo` privileges so that you can install additional software or
manage the guest OS. You can also access the `kudu-examples` as a shared folder in
`/home/demo/kudu-examples/` on the guest or from your VirtualBox shared folder location on
the host. This is a quick way to make scripts or data visible to the guest.

You can quickly verify if Kudu and Impala are running by executing the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ ps aux | grep kudu
$ ps aux | grep impalad
----

If you have issues connecting to the VM or one of the processes is not running, make sure
to consult the <<trouble, Troubleshooting>> section.

== Load Data

To perform some typical operations with Kudu and Impala, you can load the
http://www.flysfo.com/media/facts-statistics/air-traffic-statistics[SFO Passenger Data]
into Impala and then load it into Kudu.

1. Upload the sample data from the home directory to HDFS.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ hdfs dfs -mkdir /data
$ hdfs dfs -put examples/SFO_Passenger_Data/MonthlyPassengerData_200507_to_201506.csv /data
----
2. Create a new external Impala table to access the plain text data. To connect to Impala
in the virtual machine issue the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ssh demo@quickstart.cloudera -t impala-shell
----
+
Now, you can execute the following commands:
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE passenger_data_raw (
  id int,
  activity_period int,
  operating_airline string,
  airline_iata_code string,
  published_airline string,
  published_airline_iata_code string,
  geo_summary string,
  geo_region string,
  activity_type_code string,
  price_category_code string,
  terminal string,
  boarding_area string,
  passenger_count bigint
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/data/';
----
+
3. Validate if the data was actually loaded run the following command:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT count(*) FROM passenger_data_raw;

+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 13901    |
+----------+
----
+
4. It's easy to convert data from any Hadoop file format and store it Kudu using the
`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statement.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE passenger_data
TBLPROPERTIES(
'storage_handler' = 'com.cloudera.kudu.hive.KuduStorageHandler',
'kudu.table_name' = 'passenger_data',
'kudu.master_addresses' = '127.0.0.1',
'kudu.key_columns' = 'id'
 ) AS SELECT * FROM passenger_data_raw;

+-----------------------+
| summary               |
+-----------------------+
| Inserted 13901 row(s) |
+-----------------------+
Fetched 1 row(s) in 1.26s
----
+
The created table uses a simple single column primary key. See
<<kudu_impala_integration.adoc#kudu_impala,Kudu Impala Integration>> for a more detailed
introduction to the extended SQL syntax for Impala.
+
The columns of the created table are copied from the `passenger_data_raw` base table. See
http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/cloudera-impala/latest/topics/impala_create_table.html[Impala's
documentation] for more details about the extended SQL syntax for Impala.

== Read and Modify Data

Now that the data is stored in Kudu, you can run queries against it. The following query
lists the airline with the highest passenger volume over the entire reporting timeframe.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT sum(passenger_count) AS total, operating_airline FROM passenger_data
  GROUP BY operating_airline
  HAVING total IS NOT null
  ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10;

+-----------+----------------------------------+
| total     | operating_airline                |
+-----------+----------------------------------+
| 105363917 | United Airlines - Pre 07/01/2013 |
| 51319845  | United Airlines                  |
| 32657456  | SkyWest Airlines                 |
| 31727343  | American Airlines                |
| 23801507  | Delta Air Lines                  |
| 23685267  | Virgin America                   |
| 22507320  | Southwest Airlines               |
| 16235520  | US Airways                       |
| 11860630  | Alaska Airlines                  |
| 6706438   | JetBlue Airways                  |
+-----------+----------------------------------+
----

Looking at the result, you can already see a problem with the dataset. There is a
duplicate airline name. Since the data is stored in Kudu rather than HDFS, you can quickly
change any individual record and fix the problem without having to rewrite the entire
table.

[source,sql]
----
UPDATE passenger_data
  SET operating_airline="United Airlines"
  WHERE operating_airline LIKE "United Airlines - Pre%";

SELECT sum(passenger_count) AS total, operating_airline FROM passenger_data
  GROUP BY operating_airline
  HAVING total IS NOT null
  ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 10;

+-----------+--------------------+
| total     | operating_airline  |
+-----------+--------------------+
| 156683762 | United Airlines    |
| 32657456  | SkyWest Airlines   |
| 31727343  | American Airlines  |
| 23801507  | Delta Air Lines    |
| 23685267  | Virgin America     |
| 22507320  | Southwest Airlines |
| 16235520  | US Airways         |
| 11860630  | Alaska Airlines    |
| 6706438   | JetBlue Airways    |
| 6266220   | Northwest Airlines |
+-----------+--------------------+

[[trouble]]
=== Troubleshooting

==== Problems accessing the VM via SSH

* Make sure the host has a SSH client installed.
* Make sure the VM is running, by running the following command and checking for a VM called `kudu-demo`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ VBoxManage list runningvms
----
 * Verify that the VM's IP address is included in the host's `/etc/hosts` file. You should
   see a line that includes an IP address followed by the hostname
   `quickstart.cloudera`. To check the running VM's IP address, use the `VBoxManage`
   command below.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ VBoxManage guestproperty get kudu-demo /VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP
Value: 192.168.56.100
----
 * If you've used a Cloudera Quickstart VM before, your `.ssh/known_hosts` file may
   contain references to the previous VM's SSH credentials. Remove any references to
   `quickstart.cloudera` from this file.

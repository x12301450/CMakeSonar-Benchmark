NOTE: Kudu is easier to manage with link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cloudera-enterprise/cloudera-manager.htm[Cloudera Manager]
than in a standalone installation. See Cloudera's
link:http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/downloads/betas/kudu/0-5-0.html[Kudu documentation]
for more details about using Kudu with Cloudera Manager.

== Starting and Stopping Kudu Processes

include::installation.adoc[tags=start_stop]

== Kudu Web Interfaces

Kudu tablet servers and masters expose useful operational information on a built-in web interface,

=== Kudu Master Web Interface

Kudu master processes serve their web interface on port 8051. The interface exposes several pages
with information about the cluster state:

- A list of tablet servers, their host names, and the time of their last heartbeat.
- A list of tables, including schema and tablet location information for each.
- SQL code which you can paste into Impala Shell to add an existing table to Impala's list of known data sources.

=== Kudu Tablet Server Web Interface

Each tablet server serves a web interface on port 8050. The interface exposes information
about each tablet hosted on the server, its current state, and debugging information
about maintenance background operations.

=== Common Web Interface Pages

Both Kudu masters and tablet servers expose a common set of information via their web interfaces:

- HTTP access to server logs.
- an `/rpcz` endpoint which lists currently running RPCs via JSON.
- pages giving an overview and detailed information on the memory usage of different
  components of the process.
- information on the current set of configuration flags.
- information on the currently running threads and their resource consumption.
- a JSON endpoint exposing metrics about the server.
- information on the deployed version number of the daemon.

These interfaces are linked from the landing page of each daemon's web UI.

== Kudu Metrics

Kudu daemons expose a large number of metrics. Some metrics are associated with an entire
server process, whereas others are associated with a particular tablet replica.

=== Listing available metrics

The full set of available metrics for a Kudu server can be dumped via a special command
line flag:

[source,bash]
----
$ kudu-tserver --dump_metrics_json
$ kudu-master --dump_metrics_json
----

This will output a large JSON document. Each metric indicates its name, label, description,
units, and type. Because the output is JSON-formatted, this information can easily be
parsed and fed into other tooling which collects metrics from Kudu servers.

=== Collecting metrics via HTTP

Metrics can be collected from a server process via its HTTP interface by visiting
`/metrics`. The output of this page is JSON for easy parsing by monitoring services.
This endpoint accepts several `GET` parameters in its query string:

- `/metrics?metrics=<substring1>,<substring2>,...` - limits the returned metrics to those which contain
at least one of the provided substrings. The substrings also match entity names, so this
may be used to collect metrics for a specific tablet.

- `/metrics?include_schema=1` - includes metrics schema information such as unit, description,
and label in the JSON output. This information is typically elided to save space.

- `/metrics?compact=1` - eliminates unnecessary whitespace from the resulting JSON, which can decrease
bandwidth when fetching this page from a remote host.

- `/metrics?include_raw_histograms=1` - include the raw buckets and values for histogram metrics,
enabling accurate aggregation of percentile metrics over time and across nodes.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s 'http://example-ts:8050/metrics?include_schema=1&metrics=connections_accepted'
----

[source,json]

                "total_sum": 520098
            }
        ]
    }
]

NOTE: All histograms and counters are measured since the server start time, and are not reset upon collection.

=== Collecting metrics to a log

Kudu may be configured to periodically dump all of its metrics to a local log file using the
`--metrics_log_interval_ms` flag. Set this flag to the interval at which metrics should be written
to a log file.

The metrics log will be written to the same directory as the other Kudu log files, with the same
naming format. After any metrics log file reaches 64MB uncompressed, the log will be rolled and
the previous file will be gzip-compressed.

The log file generated has three space-separated fields. The first field is the word
`metrics`. The second field is the current timestamp in microseconds since the Unix epoch.
The third is the current value of all metrics on the server, using a compact JSON encoding.
The encoding is the same as the metrics fetched via HTTP described above.

WARNING: Although metrics logging automatically rolls and compresses previous log files, it does
not remove old ones. Since metrics logging can use significant amounts of disk space,
consider setting up a system utility to monitor space in the log directory and archive or
delete old segments.

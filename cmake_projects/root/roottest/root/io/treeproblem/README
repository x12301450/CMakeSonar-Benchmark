To make the test, simply do 

  make check 

This is using ROOT 3.03/02 on a PIV, Red Hat 7.2. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

`Foo' is a very simple class, just contains an integer.  

`writer' makes the file `file.root' with `TTree' `tree' in it.  The
`TTree' has one branch containing a `TClonesArray' of `Foo' objects.
There are 100 entries in the `TTree'. 

`reader' reads the file `file.root' an prints out the integer in the
`Foo' objects directly.  This program gets `SIGSEGV' in
`TTree::GetEntry(Int_t)'. 

`tree' is the result of `tree->MakeClass()' and modified so that it
does the same as `reader'.  Executed as 

  root[0] .L tree.C
  root[1] tree* t = new tree
  root[2] t->Loop();

works fine.

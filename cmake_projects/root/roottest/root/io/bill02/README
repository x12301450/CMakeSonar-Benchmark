Philippe,

The example enclosed is used as follows:

1) Set ROOTSYS to point to ROOT 3.0.3.
2) Run 'buildit' to build 'x'.  This first runs rootcint.
3) Run x (no arguments).
4) Note the size of "mytest.root" indicates that the int[10000] array is not written to disk.
Note that compression is turned off.
This doesn't work, but gives no error.
If ClassDef() and ClassImp() are uncommented, everything works.

This is a more serious problem than the one with STL vectors.

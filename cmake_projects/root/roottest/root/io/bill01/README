Philippe,

The example enclosed is used as follows:

1) Set ROOTSYS to point to ROOT 3.0.3.
2) Run 'buildit" to build 'x".  This first runs rootcint.
3) Run x with two arguments, like so: x <allocated> <filled>,
where allocated and filled refer to the size of vector<int>.
(If filled > allocated, allocated is set to filled, so no error).
4) Note the size of "mytest.root" does not increase as the vector grows.
This doesn't work, but gives no error.
If ClassDef() and ClassImp() are uncommented, everything works.

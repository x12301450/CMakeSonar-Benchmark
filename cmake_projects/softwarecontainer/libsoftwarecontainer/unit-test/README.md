Unit tests for softwarecontainer
============================

To run the tests for the lib, there are two things to remember
1. The tests need to be run as root
2. The root user needs to have a dbus session bus running (dbus-launch --session)

__NOTE__: The only currently working test suite is the lib tests. The other tests
are kept for reference only, but are not built.

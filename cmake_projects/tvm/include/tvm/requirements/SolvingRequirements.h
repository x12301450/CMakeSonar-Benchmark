/** \internal when adding a task to a problem, the user will want to specify
 * part or all of the following: priority level, (global) weight,
 * different weights for each dimension, type of norm to consider (and
 * maybe more in the future). The method through which tasks are added
 * need then to be able to accommodate these specifications.
 *
 * The classes in this file are meant to fulfill the following points:
 *
 *  - having strongly typed notions of weight, priority, ...
 *
 *  - letting the user specify only part of those notions and rely on
 *  default value for the others.
 *
 *  - allowing to use any order to give the arguments
 *
 *  - while not having to multiply the overload for the method adding
 *  the task (there are 65 combinations!).
 *
 * FIXME: should we add the notion of row selection here as well ?

/**
 * @mainpage qAccordion - Cute Accordion redefined
 *
 * qAccordion provides an accordion widget for Qt 5. The widget is heavily
 * inspired by the [jQuery UI accordion control](https://jqueryui.com/accordion/).
 *
 * ## Dependencies
 *
 * This widget is for Qt 5 only. I highly recommend cmake for building it.
 *
 * ## Setting up qAccordion
 *
 * Using qAccordion in your project is possible in two ways.
 * 1. Add the source code to your project and use it directly.
 * 2. Compile a shared library using cmake and link your application with it.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * You can add this widget to a GUI via the Qt Designer or programmatically but
 * you can not use the Designer to configure the widget.
 *
 * A simple usage example can be found in the README. A more detailed approach is
 * used in the demo application located in the test folder.

# Rho Language Issues and Fixes

This file documents the issues with the Rho language implementation and the fixes that have been made.

## Issues

The Rho language implementation had an issue where binary operations were being wrapped in Continuations, 
which was causing type mismatch errors when executing Rho code.

## Fix Summary

The fix involved modifying the RhoTranslator.cpp file to remove Continuations wrapping from various operations:

1. TranslateBinaryOp - removed PushNew() and Append(Pop()) calls that were wrapping binary operations in Continuations
2. TranslateCall - simplified to not use Continuations for wrapping call operations
3. TranslateIf - modified to create Continuations for the then and else blocks, but not for the entire if statement
4. TranslateFunction - modified to create a Continuation for the function body, but not wrap it in another Continuation
5. TranslateWhile/TranslateDoWhile - simplified to avoid unnecessary Continuation nesting
6. Assignment - modified to not wrap assignments in Continuations

## Remaining Work

There might still be issues with some tests, especially those that expect Pi behavior while running Rho code.
The core issue appears to be in the TranslatorBase class, which wraps the entire translation in a Continuation.

## Implementation Note

In Pi, binary operations are directly appended to the code array. In Rho, we had been wrapping these operations
in Continuations, which was causing type mismatches when executing the code. The fix removes these unnecessary
Continuation wrappers.

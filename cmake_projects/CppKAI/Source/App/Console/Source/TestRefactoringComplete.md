# Container Test Refactoring - Final Status

## Summary
Successfully refactored container tests to create dedicated test files for Array and Map containers.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Test Files Created
- **TestArray.cpp** - 17 comprehensive Array tests
- **TestMap.cpp** - 11 comprehensive Map tests

### 2. Files Modified
- **CoreContainerTests.cpp** - Reduced to only contain TestNestedContainers
- **CMakeLists.txt** - Added TestArray.cpp and TestMap.cpp to build

### 3. Test Distribution

#### TestArray.cpp (17 tests)
- 7 core array tests (basic operations, mixed types, etc.)
- 10 Array::Insert specific tests (comprehensive coverage)

#### TestMap.cpp (11 tests)
- 5 tests from original TestContainer/TestMap.cpp
- 6 tests from CoreContainerTests.cpp

#### CoreContainerTests.cpp (1 test)
- TestNestedContainers (Array of Maps interaction test)

## Known Issues & Notes

### 1. Duplicate Files
- Original TestContainer/TestMap.cpp still exists
- New TestMap.cpp contains all tests from original plus more
- Both are included in build but tests have different names

### 2. TestVector.cpp Confusion
- TestVector.cpp actually tests Array (not a separate Vector class)
- Contains a test class named "TestArray" (potential naming conflict)
- Comment in file: "WHY THE FUCK did I call this an Array"

### 3. Additional Array/Map Tests Elsewhere
- TestAdditionalCore.cpp has some array tests
- TestBinaryStream.cpp has array/map related tests
- These were not moved to maintain existing test structure

## Build Status
- All files compile successfully
- No compilation errors
- One warning in TestMap.cpp (unused variable m1)

## Benefits Achieved
1. Better organization - each container has dedicated test file
2. Easier to find and add tests for specific containers
3. CoreContainerTests.cpp reduced from 800+ to 48 lines
4. Consistent test patterns across container tests
5. Comprehensive Array::Insert test coverage

## Future Considerations
1. Could remove original TestContainer/TestMap.cpp to avoid confusion
2. Could rename TestVector.cpp's TestArray class to TestVector
3. Could consolidate scattered array/map tests from other files
4. Array is used as the vector-like container in KAI (no separate Vector class)

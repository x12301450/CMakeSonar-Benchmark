# KAI Console Zsh Features - Implementation Summary

## What was Implemented

### 1. Array::Insert Method
- **Problem**: Build was failing with "no member named 'Insert' in 'kai::Array'"
- **Solution**: Added Insert method to Array class
  - Added declaration in `/Include/KAI/Core/BuiltinTypes/Array.h`
  - Added implementation in `/Source/Library/Core/Source/BuiltinTypes/Array.cpp`
  - Created Insert2 wrapper method for proper method registration
  - Registered the method in Array::Register

### 2. Zsh-like History Expansion Features
All requested features from the previous conversation have been successfully implemented in the KAI Console:

#### Basic History Features
- `!!` - Repeat last command
- `!n` - Execute nth command from history (1-based)
- `!-n` - Execute nth command from the end
- `!string` - Execute last command starting with 'string'

#### Advanced Features
- **Word Designators**: `:0`, `:^`, `:$`, `:*`, `:n`, `:n-m`, `:n*`
- **Complex patterns**: `!-3:4*` (words 4 through end from 3 commands ago)
- **Quick Substitution**: `^old^new^`
- **Search Anywhere**: `!?string?`
- **Argument Shortcuts**: `!$`, `!^`
- **History Modifiers**: `:h`, `:t`, `:r`, `:e`, `:p`, `:q`, `:x`, `:u`, `:l`
- **Substitutions**: `:s/old/new/`, `:gs/old/new/`

### 3. Shell Integration (3 Methods)
1. **Backticks**: `` `ls -la` `` - Execute shell command inline
2. **Dollar Prefix**: `$ ls -la` - Quick shell command execution
3. **Shell Mode**: `sh` command switches to shell mode with "Bash Î»" prompt

### 4. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation files (all in CamelCase as requested):
- Readme.md - Main documentation index
- QuickStartGuide.md - Basic usage guide
- ShellModeDemo.md - Shell mode features
- AdvancedZshFeatures.md - Detailed feature documentation
- TestAllFeatures.md - Complete test checklist
- And many more demo and example files

## Key Implementation Files Modified

1. **Console.h** (`/Include/KAI/Console/Console.h`)
   - Added zsh feature method declarations
   - Added shellMode flag and command history vector

2. **Console.cpp** (`/Source/Library/Executor/Source/Console.cpp`)
   - Implemented all zsh history expansion features
   - Added shell command processing ($ prefix and shell mode)
   - Modified Run() method for colored prompts and feature processing

3. **ExecutorWindow.cpp** (`/Source/App/Window/Source/ExecutorWindow.cpp`)
   - Updated to match Console behavior

4. **Array.h/cpp** (Core library)
   - Added Insert method to fix compilation error

## Testing
All features have been tested and are working correctly:
- History expansion works as expected
- Shell commands execute properly
- Shell mode toggles correctly with prompt change
- Quick substitution functions properly

## Current Status
- All requested features implemented
- Documentation complete
- Code compiles successfully
- Features tested and working
- Committed to repository (without mentioning Claude)

The KAI Console now has full zsh-like history expansion capabilities as requested!

## Architecture Summary

KAI is a sophisticated distributed object model that enables:

1. **Multi-Language Programming**: Pi (stack-based), Rho (infix), Tau (IDL)
2. **Distributed Computing**: Seamless object and computation distribution
3. **Console Networking**: Real-time console-to-console communication
4. **Incremental Garbage Collection**: Smooth memory management
5. **Network Transparency**: Remote objects appear local

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Registry-Centric Architecture
- All objects managed through central Registry
- Type-safe object creation and lifecycle management
- Reflection and introspection capabilities
- Incremental tri-color garbage collection

### 2. Continuation-Based Execution
- Stack-based virtual machine (Executor)
- Continuations as first-class objects
- Uniform execution model across all languages
- Support for distributed computation

### 3. Language Interoperability
- Common AST and translation pipeline
- Rho compiles to Pi, Pi executes directly
- Tau generates C++ proxy/agent code
- Cross-language variable and function access

### 4. Network Transparency
- P2P architecture without central servers
- Objects and computations distribute seamlessly
- RakNet-based reliable communication
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management

## Development Workflow

### Building the Project
```bash
./b                    # Build with Clang++, C++23, Ninja
./b --gcc             # Build with GCC
./b --reconfigure     # Force reconfiguration
```

### Running Tests
```bash
Scripts/run_all_tests.sh    # Complete test suite
./Bin/Test/TestPi           # Pi language tests
./Bin/Test/TestRho          # Rho language tests
./Bin/Test/TestConsole      # Console feature tests
```

### Using the Console
```bash
./Bin/Console              # Start interactive console
pi> /network start 14600   # Enable networking
pi> 2 3 + 4 *             # Pi calculations
pi> rho                   # Switch to Rho language
rho> a = 5; print(a)      # Rho programming
```

```bash
./demo_console_communication.sh  # Interactive demo
# Creates tmux session with two communicating consoles
```

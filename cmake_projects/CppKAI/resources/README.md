## Architecture Diagrams

All diagrams are created using Mermaid syntax and can be viewed in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid rendering (GitHub, GitLab, VS Code, etc.).

### 1. Overall System Architecture
- High-level component relationships
- Data flow between major systems
- Core design patterns and principles
- Component interaction models

### 2. Language System Architecture  
- Translation pipeline overview (Lexer → Parser → Translator)
- Language hierarchy (Tau → Rho → Pi → Executor)
- Cross-language communication patterns
- AST and code generation processes

### 3. Pi Language Architecture
- Stack-based execution model and operations
- Two-stack architecture (data and context stacks)
- Continuation creation and execution flow
- Pi-specific optimization techniques and performance characteristics

### 4. Rho Language Architecture
- Infix notation translation to Pi operations
- Expression parsing with operator precedence
- Control flow translation (if/while/for → Pi constructs)
- Rho-Pi integration and variable sharing mechanisms

### 5. Tau Language Architecture
- Interface Definition Language (IDL) processing
- Multi-target code generation (Proxy/Agent/Struct)
- Network protocol integration and async operations
- Type system mapping and serialization strategies

### 6. Console Networking Architecture
- Peer-to-peer communication model
- Network message protocol design
- Thread safety and concurrency patterns
- Console command structure and flow

### 7. Build System Architecture
- CMake project organization
- Dependency relationships
- Build target configuration
- Output structure and packaging

### 8. Test System Architecture
- Test suite organization and execution
- Quality assurance workflows  
- Coverage analysis and reporting
- Continuous integration pipeline

## Key Architectural Patterns

The KAI system demonstrates several important architectural patterns:

- **Registry Pattern**: Centralized object lifecycle management
- **Virtual Machine Pattern**: Stack-based execution engine
- **Interpreter Pattern**: Multi-language execution environment
- **Proxy Pattern**: Network transparency for distributed objects
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven network communication
- **Factory Pattern**: Type-safe object creation
- **Command Pattern**: Operations as first-class objects

## Usage

These diagrams and documentation serve multiple purposes:

1. **Developer Onboarding**: Understand system architecture quickly
2. **Design Documentation**: Reference for system design decisions  
3. **Maintenance Guide**: Navigate complex system relationships
4. **Extension Planning**: Understand how to add new components
5. **Code Reviews**: Validate changes against architectural principles

## Viewing Diagrams

The Mermaid diagrams can be viewed in several ways:

1. **GitHub/GitLab**: Native Mermaid rendering in web interface
2. **VS Code**: Mermaid Preview extension
3. **Online Viewers**: [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)
4. **Local Tools**: Any Markdown viewer with Mermaid support

## System Statistics

- **Total Source Files**: 629 C++/.h files
- **Documentation Files**: 70+ README.md files  
- **Test Cases**: 200+ comprehensive test cases
- **Build Targets**: 15+ libraries and executables
- **Network Protocols**: 4 message types for console communication
- **Languages**: 3 integrated programming languages (Pi/Rho/Tau)
- **Platforms**: Linux, Windows, macOS support

## Contributing

When modifying the system architecture:

1. Update relevant architecture diagrams
2. Ensure documentation reflects changes
3. Validate against existing design patterns
4. Update system overview documentation
5. Consider impact on all architectural layers

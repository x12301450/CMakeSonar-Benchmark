# Rho Test Failure Analysis

## Summary of Issues Found

### 1. Fixed: Floating-Point Number Parsing (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: The lexer was not handling floating-point numbers correctly
- **Example**: `3.5` was being lexed as three tokens: `3`, `.`, `5`
- **Fix**: Updated the lexer to properly recognize decimal points in numbers
- **Result**: MixedTypeArithmetic test now passes

### 2. Incorrect Test Syntax - Control Structure Tests
- **Issue**: Tests are using C-style syntax that Rho doesn't support
- **Example**:
  ```c
  // INCORRECT (what tests are using):
  int result = 0;
  if (true) {
      result = 42;
  }
  
  // CORRECT (Rho syntax):
  result = 0
  if true {
      result = 42
  }
  ```
- **Affected Tests**: All control structure tests (if/else, loops, etc.)
- **Root Cause**: Tests were written assuming C-style variable declarations

### 3. Function Definition Syntax Issues
- **Issue**: Function tests may be using incorrect syntax
- **Correct Rho Syntax**:
  ```rho
  fun add(a, b) {
      return a + b
  }
  ```

### 4. Missing Language Features
Based on the test failures, some features the tests expect may not be implemented:
- Array slicing operations
- Map/dictionary operations
- Higher-order functions
- Complex data transformations

## Test Categories Analysis

### Passing Tests (125/181)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Simple expressions
- Stack operations
- Basic type handling

### Failing Tests (56/181) - Categories:
1. **Control Structures** (15 tests) - Using wrong syntax
2. **Functions** (12 tests) - Likely syntax issues
3. **Advanced Data Operations** (20 tests) - May require unimplemented features
4. **Demo Tests** (2 tests) - Comprehensive feature tests
5. **Advanced Operations** (7 tests) - Complex expressions

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Test Syntax**: Update all control structure and function tests to use proper Rho syntax
2. **Implement Missing Features**: Some tests may be failing due to unimplemented language features
3. **Create Syntax Documentation**: Document the exact Rho syntax for all language constructs
4. **Validate Feature Support**: Determine which features are actually supported vs. aspirational tests

## Next Steps

To fix the remaining tests, we need to:
1. Rewrite tests to use correct Rho syntax
2. Implement any missing language features
3. Update the lexer/parser to handle all required constructs
4. Ensure proper error messages for unsupported syntax

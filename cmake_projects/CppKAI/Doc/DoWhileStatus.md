# Do-While Loop Status in Rho Language

## Current Status

Do-while loops are partially implemented in Rho:

1. **Lexer Support**: Complete
   - Token type `DoWhile = 79` is defined
   - Keyword "do" is recognized and mapped to DoWhile token

2. **Parser Support**: Complete  
   - AST node type `DoWhile = 34` is defined
   - Parser has `DoWhileLoop()` method implemented
   - Parses do-while syntax: `do { body } while condition`

3. **Translator Support**: Not Implemented
   - `RhoTranslator.h` explicitly states: "DoWhile functionality has been removed"
   - No translation method for DoWhile AST nodes
   - Do-while statements are not converted to executable operations

## Test Results

The existing test (`TestDoWhileLoops`) shows:
- Lexer correctly identifies "do" as DoWhile token
- Parser fails to properly parse the do-while structure
- Parsing stops after the first statement before the "do"

## Required Work

To fully implement do-while loops:

1. Add `TranslateDoWhile()` method to RhoTranslator
2. Handle DoWhile case in `TranslateNode()` 
3. Generate appropriate Pi operations for do-while semantics:
   - Execute body at least once
   - Check condition after body
   - Loop if condition is true

## Example Syntax

```rho
i = 0
do
    i = i + 1
while i < 3
```

This should execute the body first, then check the condition.

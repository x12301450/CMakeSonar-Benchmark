# Networking Changes

## Overview of Changes

This document summarizes the recent networking changes and improvements made to the KAI system.

## 1. Documentation Reorganization

- Moved all markdown files to the `Doc/` folder for better organization
- Updated references to markdown files throughout the codebase
- Enhanced the `Networking.md` documentation with new sections on connection testing and peer-to-peer networking

## 2. New Network Components

### Peer-to-Peer Network Implementation

Created a true peer-to-peer networking system with SSH-like command execution semantics:

- **NetworkPeer**: A P2P implementation that can listen, connect to peers, and execute remote commands
- Support for interactive and non-interactive modes
- Remote command execution with `@peer command` syntax
- Command processor extensibility

### JSON Configuration

Added JSON configuration support for network components:

- **peer_config.json**: Configuration for the peer-to-peer network nodes
- Used Boost Property Tree for JSON parsing
- Support for predefined commands and connection settings

## 3. Remote Calculation Demonstration

Implemented a complete demonstration of peer-to-peer calculation where:

1. Two peers connect to each other
2. One peer sends a command to execute a calculation ("1+2") on the remote peer
3. The remote peer executes the calculation and returns the result (3)
4. The original peer receives and displays the result

## 4. Enhanced Testing

Added several new test scripts and test cases:

- **p2p_test.sh**: Test script that demonstrates the peer-to-peer calculation functionality
- **test_tau_interfaces.sh**: Script to verify the Tau interface definitions
- **build_and_test_network.sh**: Unified script to build and test all network components

## 5. New Documentation

Added new documentation files:

- **PeerToPeerNetworking.md**: Comprehensive documentation for the peer-to-peer system
- **ConnectionTesting.md** (renamed from connection_test_summary.md): Information about the connection testing interfaces
- **NetworkingChanges.md**: This document summarizing the changes

## How to Test the Changes

### Testing Peer-to-Peer Functionality

```bash
# Build and run the peer-to-peer calculation test
./Scripts/p2p_test.sh
```

### Running NetworkPeer Manually

```bash
# First terminal - start a peer
./build/Bin/NetworkPeer peer_config.json

# Second terminal - start another peer that connects to the first
./build/Bin/NetworkPeer peer2_config.json

# In the second peer's console, execute a remote command
@0 calc 1+2
```

## Future Work

1. Enhance the command processor to support more operations
2. Add authentication and security to the peer-to-peer system
3. Implement the Tau interface definitions as concrete classes
4. Integrate the peer-to-peer functionality with the Rho language
5. Support for peer discovery with broadcast/multicast
6. Implement advanced distributed computation examples
7. Add support for data streaming between peers

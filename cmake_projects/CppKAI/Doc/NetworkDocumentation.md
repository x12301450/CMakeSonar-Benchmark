## Learning Path

For developers new to the KAI networking system, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with [PeerToPeerSummary.md](PeerToPeerSummary.md) for a high-level overview
2. Read [Networking.md](Networking.md) for more detailed concepts
3. Follow the examples in [Scripts/network README](../Scripts/network/Readme.md)
4. Understand the architecture with [NetworkArchitecture.md](NetworkArchitecture.md)
5. Explore specific implementation details in the other documents

## Related Systems

The networking system interacts with these related KAI systems:

- **Registry System**: Object management and garbage collection
- **Serialization**: Converting objects to transmissible format
- **Tau Language**: Interface definition for network components
- **Common Language System**: Shared language infrastructure

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is KAI's networking peer-to-peer or client-server?**  
A: KAI uses a true peer-to-peer architecture where any node can connect to any other node.

**Q: How many peers can connect to a single node?**  
A: By default, a node can support up to 32 connections, but this is configurable.

**Q: Does KAI support encrypted connections?**  
A: Encryption is planned but not yet implemented. See [NetworkSecurity.md](NetworkSecurity.md) for details.

### Implementation Questions

**Q: How do I create a peer node?**  
A: See [NetworkTest README](../Source/App/NetworkTest/Readme.md) for examples of creating and using peer nodes.

**Q: How do I execute a command on a remote peer?**  
A: Use the `@peer command` syntax in the NetworkPeer application. See [PeerToPeerNetworking.md](PeerToPeerNetworking.md) for details.

**Q: How do I discover other peers on the network?**  
A: Use the PeerDiscovery component. See [NetworkTest README](../Source/App/NetworkTest/Readme.md) for examples.

# KAI Languages

The KAI system includes a generic language-construction system, which can be found at [Include/KAI/Language/Common](Include/KAI/Language/Common). For comprehensive guides on each language, see the tutorials linked below.

## Pi

Note that it is rare to write Î  directly. Rho transpiles to Pi, and you would generally write Rho.

[Pi](Doc/PiTutorial) is a post-fix language inspired by the amazing [HP48](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_48_series) calculator and [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_\(programming_language\)).

Unlike the more common infix, like "assert(1+2 == 3)", here's what you would say in Pi.

```pi
1 2 +       # push 1 and 2 onto the data stack, then execute plus
3           # the result [the onl element on the stack at this point)
3 == assert # assert that the top of the stack is 3
```

The following creates a continuation named 'add', invokes it, and prints the result:

```pi
{ 1 + } 'add # 2 add & print &
```

The syntax uses reverse Polish notation: arguments are pushed onto the stack first, and then operators are applied.

In this case:
1. The function **{ 1 + }** adds 1 to whatever is on the stack
2. **'add #** stores that function with the name "add" in the current scope
3. **2 add @** pushes 2 and the add function onto the stack
4. **&** executes the function (add) that's on the stack
5. **print &** pushes the print function onto the stack and executes it

The result is an empty stack with the console output of "3".

For more details and examples, see the [Pi Language Tutorial](Doc/PiTutorial.md).

## Rho

[Rho](Include/KAI/Language/Rho) is an *infix* language that translates to Pi code. It has a syntax similar to Python but with native continuations and the ability to embed Pi code directly.

Sample Rho code:

```rho
fun add(a) {
    return a + 1
}
print(add(2))
```

This example is functionally equivalent to the Pi example above. It defines a function that takes one argument, adds 1 to it, and returns the result. Then it calls the function with 2 and prints the result.

Rho gets translated to Pi code on the fly, making it both expressive and efficient.

For more details and examples, see the [Rho Language Tutorial](Doc/RhoTutorial.md).

## Tau

[Tau](Include/KAI/Language/Tau) is KAI's Interface Definition Language (IDL) used to describe objects that are visible across a network. 

Tau solves the problem of seamless network communication by:
1. Defining interfaces between distributed components
2. Generating proxy and agent code for transparent network communication
3. Ensuring type safety across network boundaries
4. Supporting versioning for backward compatibility

### Key Features

The Tau language has been enhanced with several features to better support network interface definitions:

- **Interface Keyword**: Explicitly define interface contracts with the `interface` keyword
- **Events**: Define event-based communication with the `event` keyword
- **Structs**: Create data structures with the `struct` keyword
- **Enums with Dot Notation**: Access enum values using `EnumType.Value` syntax
- **Default Values**: Specify initial values for fields and default parameters

Here's a simple example showing these features:

```tau
namespace KAI { namespace Network 
{
    // Define an enum
    enum ConnectionState {
        Disconnected = 0,
        Connecting = 1,
        Connected = 2,
        Failed = 3
    }
    
    // Define a struct
    struct ConnectionInfo {
        string address;
        int port;
        ConnectionState state = ConnectionState.Disconnected;  // Dot notation
        int timeout = 30;  // Default value
    }
    
    // Define an interface
    interface IConnection {
        // Methods
        bool Connect(string address, int port = 8080);  // Default parameter
        void Disconnect();
        ConnectionState GetState();
        
        // Events
        event ConnectionStateChanged(ConnectionState oldState, ConnectionState newState);
    }
}}
```

For a Tau file (foo.tau), the KAI system generates:
- foo.agent.cpp/h files for hosting a service
- foo.proxy.cpp/h files for using a service from elsewhere

If you want to host a service, you implement what's required in the agent files. If you want to use a service from elsewhere, you simply use `kai::Proxy<Service>`.

For more details and examples, see the [Tau Language Tutorial](Doc/TauTutorial.md) and [Network Tau Interfaces](Doc/NetworkTauInterfaces.md) documentation.

## Continuations

Continuations (also known as coroutines or fibers) are natively supported in both Pi and Rho languages.

Continuations allow you to yield the current command sequence to another without using threads. They are functions that can be interrupted at a certain point, then later resumed from that point.

What makes Pi and Rho unique is that they expose **two stacks**:
1. **Data stack**: Holds values being operated on
2. **Context stack**: Controls program flow

While these stacks exist in other language implementations, Pi and Rho allow you to directly manipulate the context stack, enabling powerful control flow patterns not easily accessible in most languages.

### Example in Pi
```pi
{ 
  "Step 1" trace
  yield
  "Step 2" trace
} 'process #

// Execute first part
process @
&

// Do something else
"Doing other work" trace

// Resume the continuation
continue
```

### Example in Rho
```rho
fun process() {
    print("Step 1")
    yield
    print("Step 2")
}

// Start the process
co = process()

// Do something else
print("Doing other work")

// Resume the continuation
co.resume()
```

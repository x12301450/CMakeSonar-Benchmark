# KAI Language Tests

This directory contains comprehensive test suites for all KAI programming languages: Pi, Rho, Tau, and Hlsl.

## Language Test Directories

### TestPi/
Tests for the Pi stack-based language:
- **Basic Operations**: Arithmetic, stack manipulation, data types
- **Advanced Features**: Functions, continuations, control flow
- **Language Integration**: Pi-to-Rho interoperability
- **Performance Tests**: Stack operations and memory usage
- **Script Examples**: Real-world Pi programs

### TestRho/
Tests for the Rho infix language:
- **Syntax Validation**: C-like syntax parsing and execution
- **Control Structures**: If/else, loops, functions
- **Language Features**: Variables, scoping, recursion
- **Cross-Language**: Rho-to-Pi compilation verification
- **Advanced Constructs**: Closures, generators, pattern matching

### TestTau/
Tests for the Tau Interface Definition Language:
- **Code Generation**: Proxy and stub generation
- **Network Interfaces**: Remote object definitions
- **Type System**: Complex type definitions and validation
- **Namespace Support**: Hierarchical organization
- **Integration Tests**: Generated code compilation

### TestHlsl/
Tests for HLSL (High Level Shading Language) support:
- **Shader Compilation**: HLSL to intermediate representation
- **Graphics Integration**: GPU computation support
- **Syntax Parsing**: HLSL-specific language constructs

## Common Test Infrastructure

### TestLangCommon.cpp
Shared testing utilities and base classes for all language tests:
- Language setup and teardown
- Common assertion helpers
- Cross-language execution support

## Running Language Tests

### All Language Tests
```bash
make test
ctest -R Language
```

### Specific Languages
```bash
ctest -R TestPi     # Pi language tests
ctest -R TestRho    # Rho language tests  
ctest -R TestTau    # Tau IDL tests
ctest -R TestHlsl   # HLSL tests
```

### Verbose Output
```bash
ctest -R TestRho -V  # Shows detailed test output
```

## Contributing

When adding new language tests:
1. Follow the existing test structure in each language directory
2. Add both positive and negative test cases
3. Include example scripts demonstrating the feature
4. Update the appropriate README.md file
5. Ensure tests pass on all supported platforms
